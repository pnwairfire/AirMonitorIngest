```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This article describes how to download and work with raw data from WRCC.
Begin by loading the **dplyr** and **AirMonitorIngest** libraries:

```{r libraries, echo = TRUE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(AirMonitorIngest)
```

## Raw data

The `wrcc_downloadData()` function sends a request to WRCC, asking for raw, 
ASCII data for a single monitor over some time period. 

```
fileString <- wrcc_downloadData(20210701, 20210930, unitID = 'sm16')

fileString %>%
  readr::read_lines() %>%
  head(8)
```
